Drive testing 

General:
- has sleep effect on the testing?
Because of the way the app will be used it is necessary to keep the device awake, so a "wake-lock" is held to prevent the device from sleeping. This does not apply if you start recording and press the Back button to get out of the app. In this case, the app will continue to record, but the device may go to sleep (if it has been setup to do that). If this happens then signal strength updates will stop and not resume until the device awakes.
