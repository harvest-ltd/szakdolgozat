Drive testing 

General:
- has sleep effect on the testing?

- logging into a file on Android (Android fileHandler should be inject into the common logger, maybe)

- orientation problem: tablet portrait is not looks good... 
-- problem with screen orientation change?
-- can I distinguish the screen size or device?
-- not change screen orientation?

- test name search
